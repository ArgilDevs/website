Season 1:
<br>
<br>Episode 1
<br>
<br>The Pilot episode starts off at a football bonfire, four people are seen in a forest, these 4 people discuss burying a body and about the murder weapon, which is a metal Lady Justice [1] who isn't holding the Scales of Justice whilst being blindfolded, the, what we find out later, trophy does hold the scales. The four are arguing and bickering about whether or not they want to carry a body across campus on the busiest day of the year.
<br>
<br>They continue talking about it for a few seconds, before one of them flips a coin, a coin flip that transitions into a bike wheel, 3 months earlier, which is present day, to one of the four we saw earlier cycling to the campus. He walks past some fliers for a missing girl named Lila, this will be important soon. 
<br>
<br>Annalise introduces herself and her class, she is an esteemed criminal defense attorney, and professor, as she lets her class of law students at Middleton University as well as her associates, Bonnie Winterbottom and Frank Delphino, to help her solve some of the most difficult criminal defense cases. Wes is called on in class, and he is unprepared, we learn this is because he just got off the waitlist. Annalise states that she picks 4 students to come work with her at her clinic. Flash forward back to the coin flip at the start of the episode, we now know that the 4 in the forest are, Wes Gibbins, Connor Walsh, Michaela Pratt and Laurel Castillo, they wrestle the victim's body up in Annalise’s house. 
<br>We go back to present time and see everyone in class giving their defense ideas to Annalise, with not one student being able to use the same idea as someone else, all the students go before Wes as going last was his punishment for not being able to answer a question in class earlier. Wes moves on to the finals, as well as Michaela, Laurel, Connor and Asher Millstone. Then she shows them her approach – discredit witnesses, introduce a new suspect – his business partner Lionel – then bury the evidence so the jury can’t comprehend anything but doubt. She says that’s how you get away with murder. Michaela the next day in the court house runs in and tells Bonnie that the witness is colorblind. Annalise is impressed and tells the others to step up their game. Wes that night cycles to Annalise’s pretty late at night, he knocks on her door and takes liberty and opens the door himself, He follows the sounds of voices and giggling in the back and finds Annalise with what he presumes is her husband who tells him to get the hell out. At a bar Connor flirts with a guy from the victims office and gets some evidence from him. A day or so later, we see the entire group go to a cocktail party, and we see Annalise with her husband, but not the guy that Wes saw her with. Wes is surprised and Annalise glares at him to threaten him into silence. The next day in court, Annalise calls in Detective Nate Leahy to the stand, no one knows he is, but he comes in and its the guy she was screwing when Wes burst in a few nights ago. Annalise blackmails him on the stand and makes him lie about doctored surveillance footage.  
<br>
<br>She tells the students it’s time to find out who will be joining the firm. She calls out Connor for the prize. Then also names Asher, Michaela, Laurel and says she decided to hire one more and announces that it’s Wes. Wow.
<br>
<br>A guy knocks on the door of a sorority house to check on the low water pressure. He goes to check the water tank and finds Lila’s body. Sam, Annalise’s husband, tells her that she was his student and her body has been found. She says she’s sorry. He says he just feels bad for her parents. She says she bets the boyfriend did it and he says he guesses they’ll see.
<br>
<br>We again flashforward and see the 4 roling out the carpet with the body in it, at the woods, they cover the body is sticks and wood and set it alight, the light lights up a face, SAM KEATING, ANNALISES HUSBANDS, FACE

<br>Episode 2
<br>
<br>starts off with more flash forwards to the forest behind campus, where Micheala, Connor and Laurel talk about a mysterious “she” that we don't know about yet, talking about if they ran off without them. This is the conversation that happens while Wes is off getting the murder weapon (the trophy). 
<br>
<br>We go back to present time, in which
<br>Sam and Annalise have a short chat about Lila. 
<br>
<br>
<br>We go back to class, and there is a new case, im only going to be including the cases that are fun to plot or just fun to watch in general, this case is 
<br>US v. Max St. Vincent 
<br>A husband to his wife Marjorie St. Vincent, who is heir to her parents billion-dollar fortune, who is suspected of stabbing Marjorie 16 times in the master bedroom of her house. 
<br>Max gives some backstory to how he met his wife and he gives off very ugly very killing people vibes and its just not funky and cool, he gives bad vibes, he then demonstrates the prosecution's theory on how he stabbed her 16 times by initiating sex with her by having Connor lie down on the SAME BED SHE WAS KILLED IN, LIKE UNCLEANED, BLOOD SOAKED BED STILL, WHERE SHE LOST HER LIFE and using a pen to fake stab him 16 times. Wild WILD, WILD STUFF like what the fuck is that are you kidding me thats insane behaviour. 
<br>
<br>QUICK PAUSE
<br>Lets talk nicknames given to the Keating 5. Well Theres one, keating 5 is the name that refers to the students hired at the keating law firm, Michaela, Asher, Wes, Laurel and Connor 
<br>
<br>Michaela is referred to as Prom Queen
<br>Asher is called douche face 
<br>Wes is the puppy and is called waitlist a lot 
<br>Laurel is called franks girl in some remarks, and wallflower, which basically just means shy and awkward.
<br>And connor has not a lot of nicknames, one being hair gel that is not used very often.
<br>
<br>Ok back to the episode, wes gets told to go and get a report for the arrest of the client, he gets home and rebecca knocks on his door and asks to use his shower since hers isnt working properly, we learn about a rudy who lived there before wes who was also a law student and rebecca describes him as “the freak who lived here before you”. This will be important later 
<br>
<br>It’s also pretty noticeable that Wes is attracted to rebecca. 
<br>
<br>We then flash forward to the woods, where the 4 are talking about the coin flip, 
<br>
<br>Heads, we get the body
<br>Tails we leave it where it is
<br>
<br>Wes flips the coin, but this time we find out the outcome, which is tails but he lies and tells the rest of the group that it was heads. THIS WILL BE REALLY FOOKIN IMPORTANT LATER DO NOT FORGET THIS. 
<br>
<br>It cuts back to present day, the group is sat in the keating house watching the news about lila, which officially states that lilas death was indeed a homicide, there is no official suspects but the police interviewed her boyfriend Griffin O’Reilly who wes saw arguing with rebecca in her home in the pilot. 
<br>
<br>In the arrest report for Max there are 3 officers names listed, whilst in the prosecution's murder book there were only 2. Annalise shows this supplemental report in a cross examination of the officer listed in the murder book, officer dorsey. But Officer mullens actually found the murder weapon and he was under investigation for drinking on the job. 
<br>
<br>They had to discredit the other witness now which is the victims best friend, Connor goes to Oliver, the guy who got emails to help win connor the trophy and annalise the case from the pilot, to get information, illegally, on the victims best friend, Connor asks Oliver to go to dinner on wednesday. 
<br>Asher, Micheala and Frank dig through another witnesses trash, he was a neighbor who apparently saw Max outside his house in the dark, they find a receipt to a strip club, but dont use it in court. 
<br>
<br>Laurel finally comes out of her shell and steps up to write up the cross examination witness questions, Annalise calls her franks girl and tells her to get them on her desk by midnight. 
<br>
<br>Annalise and Nate have a conversation about how she blackmailed him on the stand. Quick pause, i didnt mention this before but his Wife was just diagnosed with stage 4 cance. 
<br>
<br>We then flash forward to the murder period of time again and you can tell by the twilight-like filter, that makes it blueish-green and weird, it does REALLY help to tell when there is a flash forward, also because of this sound *pause for a second*. We see wes buying lighter fluid and stuff and also a prepaid cell, he calls someone telling this person that they will take care of it (the body disposal) and that they are going to protect the person on the other end of the call. 
<br>
<br>It then cuts back to present time. Annalise goes up to her room, Sam is in the shower, and she looks through his emails for anything to do with Lila. Also Sam calls Annalise by her nickname “Annie”. 
<br>
<br>Wes talks to Rebecca about Lila, and saying sorry to her about lila, he says, quote, “i just wanted to say sorry, if she was your friend too”, rebecca says that Lila wasnt her friend, THIS WILL BE MOST VERY LITERALLY THE PINNACLE OF IMPORTANCE LATER. 
<br>
<br>Laurel comes back to the keating house to give Annalise the witness questions, she puts them on Bonnies desk and they talk about something bonnie said off comment about why any of the keating 5 are working for annalise, and bonnie says one of the most QUOTABLE LINES OF THE SHOW 
<br>
<br>“I LOOK NICE, I KNOW BUT THAT'S JUST MY FACE” 
<br>It fucking slays. 
<br>
<br>That entire convo is SLAY. 
<br>
<br>We go to the class again and they are talking about the pretrial prep for the witness questions for Max’s daughter. 
<br>
<br>Then it cuts to her on the stand, talking about how her mother, max’s first wife, died in a car accident when she was 3. The prosecution brings up that Max and Marjorie were having an affair when Max’s first wife was alive.  and that the car accident was a lie. 
<br>
<br>OOOH THE DRAAAAAAAAAAAMA.
<br>
<br>Annalise is drinking, and Annalise asks Sam some questions about Lila. She asks if sam had been sleeping with Lila, he says no. We also find out that Sam has slept with his students before.
<br>Frank comes into Annalises office with information, and Annalise proposes to the keating 5 that they have to prove that even if max killed his first wife that he didnt kill marjorie. 
<br>
<br>Laurel says that he is a hunter, which means that he will know how to kill. Marjories death was not a very easy murder, 16 STABS, and blood going all over the walls. 
<br>
<br>Max demonstrates how to kill with the least suffering, usually used on animals, in court on Bonnie. 
<br>
<br>The case ends with a not-guilty verdict.
<br>
<br>Connor goes over to Olivers home and brings dinner over with him since he missed their dinner on wednesday. 
<br>
<br>Annalise comes home to sam making a candlelit dinner for the two, as he goes down to get a bottle of wine, she checks his emails for lila stangard again but this time all the emails between the two have been erased. 
<br>
<br>Annalise goes and tries to convince Nate to investigate and find out if Sams alibi checks out for the night that Lila was killed. He eventually gives in and does it for her. 
<br>
<br>At the end of the episode Rebecca and Griffin are both arrested for the murder of Lila stangard. 
<br>Wes finds a phone in his bathroom that Rebecca placed there when she came over for a shower.  We flash forward to the murder time again and we see wes cycling to room 203, which was the room he called in a flash forward earlier in the episode, and we find out the she and her Connor, Laurel and Michaela were talking about earlier and the person they are protecting is Rebecca. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Episode 3
<br>
<br>Episode 3 begins with more flash forwards to the murder, now we see rebecca with the other 4. Sam is on the floor of the keating house bleeding out. 
<br>
<br>We then go back to present time (2 months prior to the murder) 
<br>
<br>Michaela and her fiance, Aiden, are in bed talking about the future, when michaela gets called back to the Keating house. 
<br>
<br>Wes tries to find information on rebecca at the jail and sees Griffin exit the jail. Annalise is in a meeting with the university president, and we find out griffin posted bail, Annalise is asked to represent griffin in court, she said she needs to think about it. 
<br>
<br>Nate is trying to find out if Sams alibi checks out. And Nate finds out that Sam didnt show up for a lecture at Yale the night of Lila’s murder. 
<br>
<br>We then go back to the house and find out that Aiden and Connor were in the same boarding school together. Connor makes an aside to Michaela that they have more in common then they thought, implying that Connor and Aiden dated or had segguasal intercourse at some point. 
<br>
<br>Annalise, her associates and the K5 go to the jail to pick up a client, that being Paula Murphy, who had sex in a park. When Paula was being escorted out by the Keating group, the FBI drives up and arrests Paula Murphy under the name Elena Aguilar, for a bombing in 1994. 
<br>
<br>Connor makes another offhand comment about Aiden saying “it makes you wonder what secrets Aiden is keeping from you, right?”.
<br>
<br>Connor said “theres no way to win this case” and Annalise takes away the trophy. 
<br>
<br>We go back to the law class and they talk about an old case about brainwashing, which is their defense in the US v. Paula Murphy (aka. Elena Aguilar) case. 
<br>
<br>Someone called Lilas phone, which Wes has. And that’s so weird. Whats weirder is him bringing her phone around with him at ALL TIMES. Like thats giving sus and weird.
<br>
<br>We flashforward to the murder time again, and they figure that the bonfire will be their best alibi, so they go to the bonfire, take tons of photos together, and the line of the episode and the title of the episode is said “Smile, or go to jail”. 
<br>
<br>Wes fakes a lawyer id or something and cheats his way into the jail to talk to rebecca, and Annalise had to bail (not actually bail) him out. Laurel meets a guy named Kan at a bar. 
<br>
<br>Michaela finds out connor and aiden did have sex when they were in boarding school, and Aiden didnt tell her about it. Michaela is giving very biphobia bierasure and just all about BAD BAD VIBES. 
<br>
<br>Gabriel (the “mastermind” / “brainwasher”) is called to the stand and plays the prosecutions side for early release. 
<br>
<br>Paula was talking to her husband at a diner and went to the restroom and ran away with gabriel. 
<br>
<br>Annalise and Nate talk inside a car about Sams Alibi and Nate lies to Annalise about Sams whereabouts on the night lila dies.  
<br>
<br>We then jump forward to the murder time, and see the 4 put black bags holding Sams remains inside connors car, when Michaela notices that she has lost her engagement ring. 
<br>
<br>Annalise goes to the university professor and tells him that she wont be taking griffins case but is instead taking rebeccas case, as well as all this she announces in class that Wes won the trophy. 
<br>
<br>As the keating gang walks to the jail to talk to rebecca the prosecution apparently got rebeccas confession on tape. 
<br>
<br>
<br>Episode 4
<br>
<br>Episode 4 starts forward in the murder time, where the one keating 5 member missing, Asher, is knocking the doors and windows of keating house, and asking for Michaela, because she stole his trophy. Asher is at the keating house because he saw Connors car in the driveway. 
<br>
<br>We jump back to present time, and Connor runs over to Oliver home, gay sex time for the fellas. 
<br>
<br>Rebecca's bail amount is set to 1 million, she tells annalise that wes told her that griffin was going to pin it on her, thats why she confessed to the murder. 
<br>
<br>Back at the keating house Frank and Bonnie ponder over who the shooting star of the k5 is.
<br>
<br>They meet a new client, Marren Trudeau, who is the founder and CEO of the brokerage firm Trudeau Securities who transacts $90 billion a year in trades. The charge against Marren is insider trading. 
<br>
<br>The fbi shows a video of Trudeau and Edson (the company in which she is suspected of buying shares from before a favorable fda ruling)
<br>
<br>After this annalise and marren are talking inside marrens office and THE GIF of the century happens. 
<br>
<br>Marren gets mad at annalise for investigating marrens employees.
<br>
<br>Nate brakes into Sams car to try to find gps coordinates for the night lila was murdered, but was caught by sam and lied to him saying “your light was on i didnt want it running the battery out”. Bonnie saw nate break into sams car and the interaction sam and nate had. 
<br>
<br>Michaela tries to steal Laurels outline for torts, and starts shouting and ranting and going all out. And Frank wins the bet against Bonnie that Prom Queen would be the shooting star. 
<br>
<br>Pax (Marrens assistant) and Connor hookup in one of the offices at Trudeau Securities. Connor leaves his phone recording audio beside Pax, as Pax makes a phone call confessing to making the inside trade. 
<br>
<br>Marren gets told that Paxton is the culprit of setting her up, and Marren makes a scene and shouts and screams and goes crazy at paxton, paxton K words himself by falling out of the window. 
<br>
<br>Annalise starts the deposition / interrogation and finds the other two employees involved in the inside trade. 
<br>
<br>Bonnie finally gets the video tape of Rebecca's confession by telling the head of the police station that Nate was illegally investigating Sam Keating. 
<br>
<br>The judge agress with annalise that the video tape shows coercion and the bail amount was lowered to $100,000, meaning that Rebecca can go back home. 
<br>
<br>We go forward to the murder time we see Connor arriving at Olivers house in the early hours of the morning after the bonfire, Connor has a panic attack outside olivers apartment. 
<br>
<br>We quickly jump back to the present, and oliver gets into connors phone and plays the audio recording of pax confessing to the insider trade and that he had sex with connor. 
<br>
<br>Oliver kicks Connor out of his apartment. 
<br>
<br>NOW BEFORE WE GET TO THE FINAL SCENES OF THIS EPISODE, lets take a quick breather because everything that happens in the last 5 minutes of this episode is the most iconic parts of the ENTIRE series. 
<br>
<br>It starts of with a quick timelapse of Philadelphia, with Naughty Boy’s “No One’s Here to Sleep” playing.  Rebecca is walking up the stairs and meets wes outside his apartment. Wes says “I’m not supposed to be talking to you”. Rebecca asks  “Why are you? Please dont tell me its cause you want a thank you. We’ll see if this ladys [Annalise] any good, maybe ill have something to thank you for”. Wes replies “Its not that *he then brings out lilas phone* its this [lilas phone] … tell me whats on the phone rebecca”. It cuts to annalise with lilas phone and the camera spins around her to show Wes behind her, Annalise says to Wes “And you thought keeping this from me would be beneficial how?”. Wes replies “She trusts me now, because i waited, she – she wouldnt if i gave it to you before. I know that sounds bad, but –” he gets cut off by annalise “Stop. does anyone else know about this?”. Wes replies “no”. Annalsie says “I need you to be completely honest with me”. Wes says “I swear to god, only rebecca and i know it exists”. Annalise agrees with wes saying “You were right, she needs someone to trust, and it looks like thats you, are you okay with that? Because its a lot of pressure, but its very important to her, and to me.”. Wes replies “I can handle it, we can use it, right? It’ll help her case”. Annalise says back “We’ll see”, Wes, confused, “WHy wouldnt we? I mean, those photos –”, Annalise cuts him off “Mr. Gibbins you did your job. Now let me do mine”. It cuts to annalise in front o her vanity taking off her earrings and rings, bracelets, necklace and wig. She also takes off her eyelashes and wipes her makeup off in this intense and performant scene, one of the main reasons i believe she won the emmy. Sam enters and says to annalise “bonnie just told me you got the girl out on bail. *he kisses her on the neck* just dont tell me you took out a second mortgage to pay for it”, annalise replies “i came close but we figured out another way”. Sam agrees in a hmm.  Annalise says “Sam?” in a quiet tone. Sam says “Yeah?”. Annalise says the line of the series “Why is your penis on a dead girls phone?”. 
<br>
<br>THE EPISODE ENDS. 
<br>
<br>
<br>Episode 5
<br>
<br>Episode 5 starts off in flash forwards to the woods, and we find out that Laurel and Frank slept together at some point. We cut to annalises class in which we see Laurel in class asking a question about jurors. 
<br>
<br>Wes asks annalise after class if she has decided to use lilas phone, she says “i dont think we hand it to them [the police] at all”. We cut to conversation after Annalise asks sam why there are dick pics of his on lilas phone. She asks how long their relationship lasted, Sam says just the summer. We also find out that sam had a wife before annalise and that annalise was sams mistress. They continue to bicker and fight and annalise tells him to get out. Sam then leaves the Keating house. 
<br>
<br>We cut back to inside the keating house where the keating gang is talking to a new client. Ryan, who shot his abusive father. 
<br>
<br>The prosecution files a motion to stop annalise from being able to use the victims abuse on the Ryans mom in court, undermining her defense. But in court one of the wtinesses mentioned ryans blog and allowed it into evidence. 
<br>
<br>Annalise gets drunk and goes to see nate, nate says that he got fired (remember when bonnie told nates boss that he was investigating sam) and nate admitted to annalise that he lied about sams whereabouts the night lila was killed. 
<br>
<br>We flash forward to the woods yet again and Laurel steps up to bring the trophy back to Ashers. 
<br>
<br>Laurel prints something out, and the next day leaves a document explaining jury nullification, and one of the jurors finds it. 
<br>
<br>They win the case, slightly, it was a mistrail and the DA bumped the case down to juvenile court meaning he wont serve time in a prison. 
<br>
<br>Sam comes back to the house and annalise shocks him by telling him hes doing a psych eval on rebecca (even though thats a lie, and annalise is trying to figure out what lila told rebecca about sam, if anything at all) 
<br>
<br>We jump forward to the murder timeline and learn that Laurel goes to franks apartment in the early hours of the morning and lies and tells him that she stole the trophy of asher and that it was a stupid idea. 
<br>
<br>Back in present time frank and laurel talk about the jury tampering situation and that frank didn't tell annalise that it was her. Frank and Laurel kiss in the entryway of the Keating house. Laurel runs to Kans work and they have sex in that office. 
<br>
<br>Rebecca looks at the wallpaper in annalises bedroom and finds out that it matches the dick pic on lilas phone, she tells wes, meaning that Wes and Rebecca both know that Sam was Mr. Darcy (which is the name that lila gave him to talk about him to others) 
<br>
<br>Episode 6
<br>
<br>Episode 6 starts off in the murder time, and we see asher dancing in his apartment and whilst he is on a call with someone he notices that michaela stole the trophy off him. It cuts to asher banging the door at the keating house. Asking for michaela and the trophy.
<br>
<br>We cut back to preset time and we see that Wes left the trophy on his desk in keatings class, as the other members of the keating 5 enter. Bonnie rushes into class and whispers to Annalise that they can work an appeal for a death row case for David Allen who was convicted on only circumstantial evidence. We find out that Ashers dad was the judge on the US v. David Allen case. Annalise goes to Wes’ home and talks to him and convinces him to come back, he said he would if Annalise and Frank were able to get rebecca back, oh yeah i didnt mention but rebecca has ran away. Wes comes back to the Keating house and  gets brought up to speed on the US v. David Allen case. 
<br>
<br>We see Asher in his childhood home and see him rooting around looking for a book, in which he notices that theres a page missing. 
<br>
<br>We find out that the only alibi David had in this case overdosed 15 months ago. 
<br>We also see Annalise crying in her office looking at all the files. 
<br>
<br>We find out that a senator was upping rent in the area David lived to force black people out of the area. And that the key eyewitness lives in one of the buildings owned by that senator. 
<br>
<br>Senator Trucco is subpoenaed and was brought into the court to be cross examined. 
<br>
<br>Viola (the actor playing annalise) does this incredible cross examination im going to play out in full, it is not only incredible but powerful and makes you sit on the edge of your seat wondering if they will win the case is INSANE. 
<br>
